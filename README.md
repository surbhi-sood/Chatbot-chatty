# juit-chatbot
This python project uses NLTK library to answer all your questions, queries and get information about JUIT, Solan. Some sample questions are : 
"Good Afternoon" 
"Tell me about JUIT"
"How to get into JUIT ?"
"What to do in JUIT ?" 
"What events are there in JUIT ?" 
"What is the placement record in JUIT ?"

In the future, I intend to improve the json dataset in order to respond with more accurate responses and integrate the chatbot to the official university website.
